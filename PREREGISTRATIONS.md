# Preregistrations

Decision rules recorded BEFORE seeing results. The discipline that kept this project
honest lived in session notes until now (gaps-audit 4.6); this file makes it durable.
Append-only: each entry states the experiment, the decision rule, and — filled in later —
the outcome. An analysis whose rule isn't written down here first doesn't get to call
itself confirmatory.

## 2026-07-04 — OQ-5 acceptance criteria (written before the harness ran)

Rule: model "generalizes" iff (1) held-out ρ ≥ 0.8× split-half ceiling on every layout,
(2) layout-ranking τ > 0 every fold, (3) beats distance+wpm baseline on ≥3/4 layouts,
(4) no catastrophic {layout×wpm} cell, (5) stable across ≥3 seeds. Failing ⇒ label the
model QWERTY-family, remediate via OQ-1/OQ-7.
**Outcome:** freq-live model FAILED (1) and (3) → caveat fired. R1W remediation later
passed (3) 12/12, (1) on 3/4 (qwerty .796–.800 borderline). Recorded in OQ-5 artifact.

## 2026-07-04 — OQ-1 decisive A/B (freq feature vs pinned)

Rule: decisive = layout-level τ; if B ≥ A on τ → drop the feature; A > B only on
per-bigram ρ → STILL drop (practice-fit is ranking-irrelevant).
**Outcome:** B won τ (+0.667 vs +0.333) and beats-baseline (4/4 vs ~1/4); A won only ρ —
the exact pre-registered drop branch. Freq deleted from schema (2026-07-05.1).

## 2026-07-04 — practice-confound arm matrix (B/R1/R2/W/R1W)

Rule: decisive = pooled held-out τ (mean over 3 seeds); tie-break 1 = mean ρ/ceiling;
tie-break 2 = beats-baseline count; winner must ≥ B on decisive.
**Outcome:** R1W won (τ +1.0 all seeds, ρ/ceiling .931); adopted, productionized,
prod-path verified.

## 2026-07-05 — dvorak red flag (3 hypotheses)

Rule: (1) zero-dvorak retrain — rank unchanged ⇒ structural; (2) no-weights scoreboard —
dvorak drops ⇒ weighting confound; (3) alternation arithmetic must reproduce the gap for
the structural reading to stand.
**Outcome:** weighting refuted (ordering unchanged), structural confirmed (arithmetic
matched: predicted 0.33% vs observed 0.29pp), zero-dvorak caveat noted (self-supported
evidence). Recorded in redflag artifact.

## 2026-07-05 — F20W / R3W (bucketed-frequency arms)

Rule: adopt over shipped R1W only if pooled τ ≥ +1.0 AND mean ρ/ceiling > 0.931.
**Outcome:** F20W 0.763, R3W 0.921 — both rejected; R1W held.

## 2026-07-05 — feature-arm matrix (A1/A2/A3/A5/C2/C3 + combos)

Rule: winner = highest mean ρ/ceiling among arms holding τ +1.0 all seeds; adopt only if
> BASE + 0.005.
**Outcome:** C2A5 won (1.0002) and was adopted — then REVERTED same day when the E5
search exposed row-blindness (Goodhart). Depth-3 kept. Lesson institutionalized as E5:
feature DELETIONS additionally require an optimizer-side structural gate.

## 2026-07-05 — local-WPM arms (S/L8/LS)

Rule: adopt local iff τ ≥ anchor AND mean ρ/ceiling > S + 0.005; anchor S must reproduce
the shipped pipeline for external validity.
**Outcome:** L8 rejected decisively (0.841 vs 0.918). LS nominally +0.014 but anchor
under-reproduced prod (extraction mismatch) and grouping confound (3.65M vs 145k
examples) → no adoption; documented.

## 2026-07-05 — OQ-14 (position practice) three tests

Rule: probe-S gap must GROW with wpm for the practice reading; arm PU adopted only if
LOLO holds τ AND E5 home-share rises materially; arm DW home-share rise ⇒ dvorak-limited
signal.
**Outcome:** gap +1/+6/+3 ms (no growth) → near-tie; PU improved LOLO (1.032) but
home-share flat (34.1% vs 33.7%) → validated-available, unadopted; DW 42.8% → home signal
lives in dvorak's data. OQ-14 resolved: comfort question.

## 2026-07-05 — lag-2 finger-reuse penalty

Rule (implicit, stated in the driver): a recovery-time mechanism must show a positive
lag-2 penalty after controlling constituent classes; ~zero ⇒ utilization is a comfort
axis, not a speed term.
**Outcome:** −13 ms weighted (−6 alt/alt, −25 shb/shb) → no recovery mechanism at lag 2;
utilization reclassified to OQ-4.

## 2026-07-05 — trigram LOLO (Phase B keystone; rule written before the run)

Experiment: `keybo validate --ngram trigram` on tristrokes_v1.tsv, seeds 0/1/2, same cell
construction (layout, trigram, session-wpm bucket), split-half ceilings per layout.
Rule: the trigram model earns objective-status iff (1) pooled held-out τ = +1.0 all
seeds, (2) mean ρ/ceiling ≥ 0.80 (trigram cells are thinner; the bigram 1.0 bar is not
expected), (3) beats a distance-sum baseline (dist(a,b)+dist(b,c)+wpm linear) on ≥ 8/12
fold-seeds. Secondary (roll question): the model's predicted run-continue vs run-redirect
contrast must agree in SIGN with the raw-data probe (roll_error_probe.py) for the
trigram objective to claim it prices rolls from data.
**Outcome:** (pending)

## 2026-07-05 — roll additivity + error geometry probes

Rule: (R) run-continue median delta < alt-alt delta − 10 ms ⇒ rolls are sub-additive and
the trigram objective materially matters; run-redirect > alt-alt + 10 ms ⇒ redirects
super-additive. Between ±10 ms ⇒ bigram sums approximately suffice and the trigram
objective's value is small. (E) any row/finger error-rate spread > 1.5× between best and
worst cell, or sfb-preceded error rate > 1.5× alt-preceded ⇒ error term enters the
objective backlog with measured weights; else error stays out of scope.
**Outcome:** (pending)
