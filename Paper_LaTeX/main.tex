\begin{abstract}
 The QWERTY layout, first developed in the 1870s for typewriters, is the most widely used keyboard layout today despite its inefficiencies. The development of an alternative layout faces two major challenges: quantifying the impact of ergonomic features and effectively navigating the vast search space of possible keyboard layouts. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a data-driven approach using simulated annealing with an objective function derived from empirical typing data. The two data sets used are the 136M Keystrokes data set from Aalto University, containing 8,228 hours of typing data from 168,000 participants, for a controlled analysis of four layouts (AZERTY, Dvorak, QWERTY, and QWERTZ), and the iWeb corpus, one of the largest collections of English text, for frequency analysis. A custom implementation of simulated annealing is employed, featuring a dynamic initial temperature and termination criterion that enables compatibility with different subsets of keys, corpora, and optimization criteria. An analysis reveals a number of factors that impact typing speed. Based on this analysis, a cost function is devised and fine-tuned using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (MAE:$12$ms, R$^2$:$0.78$ at $80$ WPM). To estimate the typing efficiency of a candidate layout, the cost function evaluates the predicted typing time for each sequence in the corpus based on the given layout. The sum of these predicted times serves as the objective function for optimization via simulated annealing. The result is a layout estimated to be $6\%$ faster for typing English compared to QWERTY.
\end{abstract}
% While prior researchers have identified various ergonomic principles, they often rely on observations and theoretical models to inform layout design, rather than developing evaluation models based on quantifiable data.

% Simulated annealing optimizes on estimated typing time for the corpus.
